# HoriseonSolutions-Project1

## Description

Taking an existing code and refactoring it so it meets accesibility requirements.
Need to make sure all elements of the page are working as expected so anyone that goes to it will have a pleasant user experience.
This project helped get me familiar with image placement as well as object linking 



## Table of Contents (Optional)



## Installation

Should run smoothly in any VSCode editor


## Usage

When you open the page, at the top right corner there are 3 items.  You should be able to click on each link and be take directly to that section on the page.
Please critique and let me know what I have missed.
